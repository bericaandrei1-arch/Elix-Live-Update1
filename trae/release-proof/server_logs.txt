STATUS: ✅ Clean start, no errors

=== SEARCH: UnhandledPromiseRejection ===
Result: ❌ NOT FOUND — 0 occurrences

=== SEARCH: uncaught ===
Result: ❌ NOT FOUND — 0 occurrences

=== SEARCH: ECONNRESET ===
Result: ❌ NOT FOUND — 0 occurrences

=== SEARCH: socket hang up ===
Result: ❌ NOT FOUND — 0 occurrences

=== SEARCH: timeout ===
Result: ❌ NOT FOUND — 0 occurrences (ACK_TIMEOUT_MS defined as 5000ms in load test, not triggered)

=== SEARCH: out of memory ===
Result: ❌ NOT FOUND — 0 occurrences

=== SEARCH: disconnect ===
Result: ℹ️ Found in code (expected): 
  - websocket.ts: reconnect handler on disconnect (intentional)
  - agoraManager.ts: connection-state-change handler (intentional)
  - Both implement exponential backoff reconnect
  NOT a runtime error — these are disconnect HANDLERS

=== SEARCH: rate limit ===
Result: ℹ️ Found in code (expected):
  - api/rate-limit.ts: In-memory rate limiter for API endpoints
  - chatRateLimiter.ts: Client-side chat rate limiter (5 msg/10s)
  - send-gift Edge Function: 30 gifts/min per user
  NOT a runtime error — these are rate limit IMPLEMENTATIONS

=== PRODUCTION BUILD LOG ===

vite v6.4.1 building for production...
✓ 2240 modules transformed.
✓ built in 9.44s
✓ PWA v1.2.0 (generateSW, 73 precache entries, 1768.16 KiB)

SEARCH: "error" in build output → ❌ NOT FOUND
SEARCH: "failed" in build output → ❌ NOT FOUND
SEARCH: "warning" in build output → 
  - "Generated an empty chunk: vendor-agora" (non-blocking, Agora is dynamically loaded)

=== ESLINT RUN ===
0 errors, 7 warnings (all react-hooks/exhaustive-deps — non-blocking, intentional)
No production-related warnings.

=== TYPESCRIPT COMPILE ===
0 errors

=== TEST RUN ===
5/5 passed, 2 test files, 2.11s

=== NODE.JS PROCESS HEALTH ===
Node.js v24.13.0
No memory warnings
No uncaught exceptions
No unhandled promise rejections

=== CONCLUSION ===
All "red flag" search terms return ZERO runtime occurrences.
"disconnect" and "rate limit" appear only as intentional handler implementations.
Server starts clean, builds clean, no stability concerns detected.

NOTE: These are development/build server logs. Production server logs
(from Supabase Edge Functions, Vercel serverless, or DigitalOcean)
should be captured separately once deployed. Run:
  - Supabase Dashboard → Logs → Edge Functions
  - Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Function Logs
  - `doctl compute droplet logs` for DigitalOcean
