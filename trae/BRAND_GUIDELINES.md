# Brand & Market Positioning Guidelines

## 1. Brand Identity

## 2. Visual Assets

*   **Icon**: App Icon (Gold "E" or Star).

### Color System (The "Luxury" Palette)
| Name | Hex Code | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

*   **Border**: None (Shadows used for depth).
*   **Rounding**: `16px` (`rounded-lg`).

### Spacing
*   **Mobile First**: Touch targets must be at least 44px.
*   **Padding**: Standard `p-4` (16px) for containers.

## 4. Market Positioning Strategy (The "Pitch")

### What Problem Do We Solve?
*   **The Squeeze**: Existing platforms (TikTok, Twitch) take massive cuts (50-70%) and ignore mid-tier creators.
*   **The Noise**: Algorithms favor viral trends over genuine talent and community connection.
*   **The Grind**: Creators burn out trying to please an opaque algorithm.

### Why Are We Different? (The Solution)
*   **Creator-First Economics**: We offer **50-60% Revenue Share** (vs 30-50% industry avg).
*   **Luxury Gamification**: High-value "Gifts" and "Battles" make monetization fun, not begging.
*   **Transparent Growth**: Clear leveling paths (Rising Star -> Partner) based on merit, not mystery.

### Why We Will Win? (The Edge)
*   **Talent Migration**: By offering better pay, we attract the "Supply" (Creators), and their "Demand" (Fans) follows.
*   **Niche Focus**: We aren't for everyone. We are for **Premium Live Entertainment** (Music, Battles, Talk).
*   **Unit Economics**: Our lean tech stack (Serverless + Agora) allows us to be profitable at a smaller scale than giants.
